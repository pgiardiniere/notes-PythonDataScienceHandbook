### Timing code execution
# A handful of iPython magics useful for benchmarking your code's execution:
# 
# %time     Time exec of a single statement
# %timeit   Time exec of a single statement w/ more accurracy 
# %prun     Profile-Run --- Run code with the profiler
# %lprun    Line-Profile-Run --- Run code with the line-by-line profiler
# %memit    Measure memory use of a single statement
# %mprun    Memory-Profile-Run --- Run code with line-by-line memory profiler

# magics 3-6 are not included by default with iPython
# 3-4 are part of the 'line-profiler' extension
# 5-6 are part of the 'memory-profiler' extension
