# additional resource: excellent history on relation of ipython and Jupyter below:
# https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/ipython-jupyter

### launch an iPython shell:
open Anaconda Prompt & enter:
iPython
# it's basically a REPL (read-eval-print loop) with extras
# also referred to as the Python 'kernel' for jupyter


### Jupyter
# Straight from the text:
#   "The Jupyter notebook is a browser-based graphical interface to the IPython shell, 
#    and builds on it a rich set of dynamic display capabilities."

# Continued quote:
#   "Though the IPython notebook is viewed and edited through your web browser window, 
#    it must connect to a running Python process (kernel) in order to execute code."

# Recall from the article you linked that Jupyter notebooks (per the name) are compatible
# with multiple other kernels by default (one for R and one for Julia, also other 3rd party 
# ones are maintained by the community).
# also note: you can have multiple kernels in a single notebook


### launch a Jupyter session:
open Anaconda Prompt & enter:
jupyter notebook

# this will create a local server for the webapp and hook it up to port 8888, opening a link
# in your browser automatically pointing to the home dir - C:\Users\(current user)
